# Iris Recognition - Naive Bayesian Inference

**DISCLAIMER**: Presented project is just my first attempt in doing something serious with machine learning. Mind it!

The main objectives of this project are to:
* become familiar with the project-wise ML approach
* get acquainted with Pandas, Matplotlib and Scipy modules
* try out involving naive bayesian inference in a somewhat comlex problem
