# Machine Learning Microprojects

The key idea of this repository is to keep my smaller ML projects nice and tidy.

Presented projects (both the existing and the prospective ones) are mostly meant to be the milestones for me on my educational path. Thus, the chronology is very important here as I most likely won't delete nor update the projects once they're considered to be finished. Guess, it will be fun to look back one day and see how I was starting. Nevertheless, it is not out of the question that some of them might be redone in the future.
