# MNIST digit classifier (KNN classifier)

This microproject does not aim at the astonishing performance; actually it is far more important for me here to try out some recently learnt things including cross-validation in scikit-learn, some statistics (confusion matrix, precision, recall, f1-score) and a bit of decent-looking visualization.
